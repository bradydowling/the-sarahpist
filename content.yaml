about:
  title: "About Me"
  content:
    - "As a licensed clinical psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, I bring expertise in understanding therapeutic approaches, diagnostic complexity, and financial considerations that are essential in matching clients with the right care. My extensive experience in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, and other evidence-based treatments (e.g., ACT, DBT), combined with my research in digital mental health interventions, gives me unique insight into what makes therapy truly effective."
    - "Through my work seeing clients at MGH and in private practice, developing innovative mental health solutions, and supervising clinicians, I've gained a comprehensive understanding factors to consider in making a therapy match successful. This extensive experience allows me to match you thoughtfully with a therapist whose methods and personality will best serve your specific needs."
