              "Finding the right therapist can be overwhelming, but Sarah made
              the process so much easier. Navigating insurance and searching on
              my own felt exhausting, but she took the stress out of it by
              matching me with options that fit my specific needs."

              "It was extremely helpful to target my issues and figure out
              exactly what I was looking for in a therapist as well as what I
              wanted out of therapy. It's hard to find a provider that is a good
              fit and covered by insurance/affordable but you made this process
              easier!"

              overwhelmed by the options. Finding a therapist can be extremely
              hard to navigate. Having help finding a therapist took out a lot
              of the guesswork for me."
