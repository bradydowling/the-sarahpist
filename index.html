        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a licensed clinical psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital
          and instructor at Harvard Medical School, I bring deep expertise in
          understanding therapeutic approaches and matching clients with the
          right care. My extensive experience in cognitive behavioral therapy
          (CBT), exposure therapy (ERP), and other evidence-based treatments,
          combined with my research in digital mental health interventions,
          gives me unique insight into what makes therapy truly effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work supervising clinicians and developing innovative
          mental health solutions, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of
          different therapeutic styles and approaches. This expertise allows me
          to thoughtfully match you with a therapist whose methods and
          personality will best serve your specific needs.
