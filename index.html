        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a licensed clinical psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital
          and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, I bring expertise in
          understanding therapeutic approaches, diagnostic complexity, and
          financial considerations that are essential in matching clients with
          the right care. My extensive experience in cognitive behavioral
          therapy (CBT), exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, and
          other evidence-based treatments (e.g., ACT, DBT), combined with my
          research in digital mental health interventions, gives me unique
          insight into what makes therapy truly effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my work seeing clients at MGH and in private practice,
          developing innovative mental health solutions, and supervising
          clinicians, I've gained a comprehensive understanding factors to
          consider in making a therapy match successful. This extensive
          experience allows me to match you thoughtfully with a therapist whose
          methods and personality will best serve your specific needs.

              Sarah helped simplify that for me and provided suggestions for
              therapists that suited my specific needs. I'd never seen one prior
              and it was stressful trying to figure out where to start.

              In a time when my head was in a fog and I was already so

              support I needed by making it so easy.

              Sarah was instrumental in helping me find a mental health provider
              when I felt overwhelmed by the dysfunctional methods for finding
              care providers. I was quickly paired with a provider who met me
              where I was at.
